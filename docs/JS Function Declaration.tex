\title{JavaScript Function Delaration}
\author{Mosabbir Khan Shiblu}

\begin{document}
	JavaScript functions do not support overloading like Java.
	Whenever multiple functions with the same name are declared in the same scope it takes the last declaration which is hoisted up in the scope.
	
	For example if A() is declared at the end and inside of B(), it is hoisted up inside B() but not in the global scope
	
	THEREFORE the signature of the function is only the name in JavaScript
