# Concordia University's Gina Cody School of ENCS Thesis LaTeX Template + logos

This is an updated LaTeX template for Master's and Ph.D. theses in the newly renamed Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science.
It builds on [Suo Tan's version](https://github.com/Tandysony/LaTeX-Thesis-Template-for-Concordia-University-Students), and brings the following:
- Complies with 2019 requirements (they tend to change every so often...)
- Correct list and order of examiners for Master's and Ph.D.
- Some changes to support the CIISE department in the cover page
- Fixed links in the Table of Contents to the List of Figures/Tables
- Support for including thesis defence date or leaving it blank
- Removes PTEX.Fullbanner from included resources (hides resource author/dates/potential full paths)
- Vectorized Concordia and Gina Cody logos in Appendix, to be used e.g., in the thesis presentation

## Customize template
- Under `%% THESIS SETTINGS`, fill your name, thesis title, then the name of the program you are enrolled in (e.g., Computer Science), and your department.
- Next, check whether your department has the GPD or the Chair to sign the thesis and toogle `\isGpd` in the former case. Search for the name of the [current GPD of your department](https://www.concordia.ca/admissions/graduate/programs/contacts.html) if needed.
- Then, search for the name of the [current Dean of the faculty](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/about/leadership/office-dean/dean-of-engineering-and-computer-science.html).
- Fill the names of the examiners
- Fill the initial submission and defence dates if available
